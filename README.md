# A Universal/Isomorphic Node, Express, React, Redux, React-router web application

This project spun out of my interest in building progressive web applications. (This project is purely experimental).

### Still In Progress
I'm still trying to work out a good dev workflow with hot module replacement for clientside code. It's a pain to set up live-reload (hot module replacement) of React Components when we're doing serverside rendering. 

### End Goal
Hopefully, I'll be able to make a production-ready web app that can be initiated whenever I decide to start on a new web app.
